/*

Polymorphism meaning in Java refers to the ability of objects to take on many forms
Poly + Morphism = many + behaviors

Compile Time polymorphism/Static Polymorphism -> behavior is defined at compile time (decide which method will get executed)

Method Overloading ->

add(), add(int a , int b), add(int a, int b, int c)

which method will be excuted will be decided at compile time

********************************************************************************

Run Time polymorphism/Dynamic Polymorphism/Dynamic Method Dispatch -> 

behavior is defined at run time (decide which method will get executed)

Medthod Overriding ->

Class B extends A

class A has method - > add(int a, int b)  Class B also has method add(int a, int b)

Now which method out of two will be executed will be decided at runtime
